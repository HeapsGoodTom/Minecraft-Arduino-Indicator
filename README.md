MCServerStatus
==============
This project will allow you to see if your server is active or offline...

This is a work in progress to tidy up the code a little bit and to write a wiki entry on setup and custimising.

In Action!


On here you will find the code for my Server Status Shield. You should probably be familiar with PHP, BASH (and whatever language the Arduino uses) to use this.

This uses the MinecraftStatus PHP Library.
